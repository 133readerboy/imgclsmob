# Large-scale image classification networks for embedded systems
This repository contains several classification models on MXNet/Gluon and PyTorch and scripts for trainig/converting models. All models are designed for using with ImageNet-1k dataset.

## Requirements
All models/scripts are on Python. Tested on Python 2.7 and 3.6.

### For Gluon way
If you only want to use models:
```
mxnet >= 1.2.1
```
If you want also training models:
```
gluoncv >= 0.2.0
```

### For PyTorch way
```
torch >= 0.4.1
torchvision >= 0.2.1
```
