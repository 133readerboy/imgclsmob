# Large-scale image classification models on TensorFlow 2.0

This is a collection of large-scale image classification models. Many of them are pretrained on
[ImageNet-1K](http://www.image-net.org) dataset and loaded automatically during use. All pretrained models require the
same ordinary normalization. Scripts for training/evaluating/converting models are in the
[`imgclsmob`](https://github.com/osmr/imgclsmob) repo.
